## Hi, there👋

I am a GenZ youth born in 2002, who has graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Now I'm pursing the second degree of the Economic. Also now I'm preparing for the master's matriculation.

My main research realms include front-end technology development, web full-stack development, software engineering theory, and the practical application of information system projects. Additionally, I'm also an amateur in Chinese Classical Ancient Literacy.
