## Hi, there👋

I am an undergraduate student majoring in software engineering born in 2002, who is preparing for the examination for master entrance.

My main research interests include front-end technology development, web full-stack development, software engineering theory, and the practical application of information system projects.

Additionally, I am also interested in computer mathematics.
