## Hi, there👋

I am GenZ youth born in 2002, who has graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering in 2024. Now I'm pursing the master's degree of computer engineering in intelligent software. My main research realms include front-end technology development, web full-stack development, software engineering theory, and the practical application of information system projects. Additionally, I'm also an amateur in Chinese Classical Ancient Literacy.
